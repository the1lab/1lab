# Category of monoids

<!--
```agda
_ = is-prop
```
-->

The collection of all `Monoid`{.Agda}s relative to some universe level
assembles into a precategory. This is because being a monoid
homomorphism `is a proposition`{.Agda ident=is-prop}, and so does not
raise the [h-level] of the Hom-sets.

[h-level]: 1Lab.HLevel.html

```agda
instance
  H-Level-Monoid-hom
    : ∀ {ℓ ℓ'} {s : Type ℓ} {t : Type ℓ'}
    → ∀ {x : Monoid-on s} {y : Monoid-on t} {f} {n}
    → H-Level (Monoid-hom x y f) (suc n)
  H-Level-Monoid-hom {y = M} = prop-instance λ x y i →
    record { pres-id = M .has-is-set _ _ (x .pres-id) (y .pres-id) i
           ; pres-⋆ = λ a b → M .has-is-set _ _ (x .pres-⋆ a b) (y .pres-⋆ a b) i
           }
```

It's routine to check that the identity is a monoid homomorphism and
that composites of homomorphisms are again homomorphisms; This means
that `Monoid-on`{.Agda} assembles into a structure thinly displayed over
the category of sets, so that we may appeal to general results about
[[displayed categories]] to reason about the category of monoids.

```agda
Monoid-structure : ∀ ℓ → Thin-structure ℓ Monoid-on
Monoid-structure ℓ .is-hom f A B = el! $ Monoid-hom A B f

Monoid-structure ℓ .id-is-hom .pres-id = refl
Monoid-structure ℓ .id-is-hom .pres-⋆ x y = refl

Monoid-structure ℓ .∘-is-hom f g p1 p2 .pres-id =
  ap f (p2 .pres-id) ∙ p1 .pres-id
Monoid-structure ℓ .∘-is-hom f g p1 p2 .pres-⋆ x y =
  ap f (p2 .pres-⋆ _ _) ∙ p1 .pres-⋆ _ _

Monoid-structure ℓ .id-hom-unique mh _ i .identity = mh .pres-id i
Monoid-structure ℓ .id-hom-unique mh _ i ._⋆_ x y = mh .pres-⋆ x y i
Monoid-structure ℓ .id-hom-unique {s = s} {t = t} mh _ i .has-is-monoid =
  is-prop→pathp
    (λ i → hlevel {T = is-monoid (mh .pres-id i) (λ x y → mh .pres-⋆ x y i)} 1)
    (s .has-is-monoid)
    (t .has-is-monoid)
    i

Monoids : ∀ ℓ → Precategory (lsuc ℓ) ℓ
Monoids ℓ = Structured-objects (Monoid-structure ℓ)

Monoids-is-category : ∀ {ℓ} → is-category (Monoids ℓ)
Monoids-is-category = Structured-objects-is-category (Monoid-structure _)
```

By standard nonsense, then, the category of monoids admits a [[faithful
functor]] into the category of sets.

```agda
Mon↪Sets : ∀ {ℓ} → Functor (Monoids ℓ) (Sets ℓ)
Mon↪Sets = Forget-structure (Monoid-structure _)
```

## Free monoids {defines=free-monoid}

We piece together some properties of `lists`{.Agda ident=List} to show
that, if $A$ is a set, then $\rm{List}(A)$ is an object of
`Monoids`{.Agda}; The operation is list concatenation, and the identity
element is the empty list.

```agda
List-is-monoid : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} → is-set A
              → Monoid-on (List A)
List-is-monoid aset .identity = []
List-is-monoid aset ._⋆_ = _++_
List-is-monoid aset .has-is-monoid .idl = refl
List-is-monoid aset .has-is-monoid .idr = ++-idr _
List-is-monoid aset .has-is-monoid .has-is-semigroup .has-is-magma .has-is-set =
  ListPath.is-set→List-is-set aset
List-is-monoid aset .has-is-monoid .has-is-semigroup .associative {x} {y} {z} =
  sym (++-assoc x y z)
```

We prove that the assignment $X \mapsto \rm{List}(X)$ is functorial;
We call this functor `Free`{.Agda}, since it is a [[left adjoint]] to the
`Forget`{.Agda} functor defined above: it solves the problem of turning
a `set`{.Agda ident=Set} into a monoid in the most efficient way.

```agda
Free-monoid : ∀ {ℓ} → Functor (Sets ℓ) (Monoids ℓ)
Free-monoid .F₀ A = el! (List ∣ A ∣) , List-is-monoid (A .is-tr)
```

The action on morphisms is given by `map`{.Agda}, which preserves the
monoid identity definitionally; We must prove that it preserves
concatenation, identity and composition by induction on the list.

```agda
Free-monoid .F₁ f = total-hom (map f) record { pres-id = refl ; pres-⋆  = map-++ f }
Free-monoid .F-id = ext map-id
Free-monoid .F-∘ f g = ext map-∘ where
  map-∘ : ∀ xs → map (λ x → f (g x)) xs ≡ map f (map g xs)
  map-∘ [] = refl
  map-∘ (x ∷ xs) = ap (f (g x) ∷_) (map-∘ xs)
```

We refer to the adjunction counit as `fold`{.Agda}, since it has the
effect of multiplying all the elements in the list together. It "folds"
it up into a single value.

```agda
fold : ∀ {ℓ} (X : Monoid ℓ) → List (X .fst) → X .fst
fold (M , m) = go where
  module M = Monoid-on m

  go : List M → M
  go [] = M.identity
  go (x ∷ xs) = x M.⋆ go xs
```

We prove that `fold` is a monoid homomorphism, and that it is a natural
transformation, hence worthy of being an adjunction counit.

```agda
fold-++ : ∀ {ℓ} {X : Monoid ℓ} (xs ys : List (X .fst))
        → fold X (xs ++ ys) ≡ Monoid-on._⋆_ (X .snd) (fold X xs) (fold X ys)
fold-++ {X = X} = go where
  module M = Monoid-on (X .snd)
  go : ∀ xs ys → _
  go [] ys = sym M.idl
  go (x ∷ xs) ys =
    fold X (x ∷ xs ++ ys)            ≡⟨⟩
    x M.⋆ fold X (xs ++ ys)          ≡⟨ ap (_ M.⋆_) (go xs ys) ⟩
    x M.⋆ (fold X xs M.⋆ fold X ys)  ≡⟨ M.associative ⟩
    fold X (x ∷ xs) M.⋆ fold X ys    ∎

fold-natural : ∀ {ℓ} {X Y : Monoid ℓ} f → Monoid-hom (X .snd) (Y .snd) f
             → ∀ xs → fold Y (map f xs) ≡ f (fold X xs)
fold-natural f mh [] = sym (mh .pres-id)
fold-natural {X = X} {Y} f mh (x ∷ xs) =
  f x Y.⋆ fold Y (map f xs) ≡⟨ ap (_ Y.⋆_) (fold-natural f mh xs) ⟩
  f x Y.⋆ f (fold X xs)     ≡⟨ sym (mh .pres-⋆ _ _) ⟩
  f (x X.⋆ fold X xs)       ∎
  where
    module X = Monoid-on (X .snd)
    module Y = Monoid-on (Y .snd)
```

Proving that it satisfies the `zig`{.Agda} triangle identity is the
lemma `fold-pure`{.Agda} below.

```agda
fold-pure : ∀ {ℓ} {X : Set ℓ} (xs : List ∣ X ∣)
          → fold (List ∣ X ∣ , List-is-monoid (X .is-tr)) (map (λ x → x ∷ []) xs)
          ≡ xs
fold-pure [] = refl
fold-pure {X = X} (x ∷ xs) = ap (x ∷_) (fold-pure {X = X} xs)

Free-monoid⊣Forget : ∀ {ℓ} → Free-monoid {ℓ} ⊣ Mon↪Sets
Free-monoid⊣Forget .unit .η _ x = x ∷ []
Free-monoid⊣Forget .unit .is-natural x y f = refl
Free-monoid⊣Forget .counit .η M = total-hom (fold _) record { pres-id = refl ; pres-⋆ = fold-++ }
Free-monoid⊣Forget .counit .is-natural x y th =
  ext $ fold-natural (th .hom) (th .preserves)
Free-monoid⊣Forget .zig {A = A} =
  ext $ fold-pure {X = A}
Free-monoid⊣Forget .zag {B = B} i x = B .snd .idr {x = x} i
```

This concludes the proof that `Monoids`{.Agda} has free objects. We now
prove that monoids are equivalently algebras for the `List`{.Agda}
monad, i.e. that the `Free-monoid⊣Forget`{.Agda} adjunction is [monadic]. More
specifically, we show that the canonically-defined `comparison`{.Agda
ident=Comparison-EM} functor is [[fully faithful]] (list algebra homomoprhisms
are equivalent to monoid homomorphisms) and that it is [[split
essentially surjective]].

[monadic]: Cat.Functor.Adjoint.Monadic.html

```agda
Monoid-is-monadic : ∀ {ℓ} → is-monadic (Free-monoid⊣Forget {ℓ})
Monoid-is-monadic {ℓ} = ff+split-eso→is-equivalence it's-ff it's-eso where
  open import Cat.Diagram.Monad

  comparison = Comparison-EM (Free-monoid⊣Forget {ℓ})
  module comparison = Functor comparison

  it's-ff : is-fully-faithful comparison
  it's-ff {x} {y} = is-iso→is-equiv (iso from from∘to to∘from) where
    module x = Monoid-on (x .snd)
    module y = Monoid-on (y .snd)
```

First, for full-faithfulness, it suffices to prove that the morphism
part of `comparison`{.Agda} is an `isomorphism`{.Agda ident=iso}. Hence,
define an inverse; It suffices to show that the underlying map of the
algebra homomorphism is a monoid homomorphism, which follows from the
properties of monoids:

```agda
    from : Algebra-hom _ (comparison.₀ x) (comparison.₀ y) → Monoids ℓ .Hom x y
    from alg .hom = alg .hom
    from alg .preserves .pres-id = happly (alg .preserves) []
    from alg .preserves .pres-⋆ a b =
      f (a x.⋆ b)                  ≡˘⟨ ap f (ap (a x.⋆_) x.idr) ⟩
      f (a x.⋆ (b x.⋆ x.identity)) ≡⟨ (λ i → alg .preserves i (a ∷ b ∷ [])) ⟩
      f a y.⋆ (f b y.⋆ y.identity) ≡⟨ ap (f a y.⋆_) y.idr ⟩
      f a y.⋆ f b                  ∎
      where f = alg .hom
```

The proofs that this is a quasi-inverse is immediate, since both "being
an algebra homomorphism" and "being a monoid homomorphism" are
properties of the underlying map.

```agda
    from∘to : is-right-inverse from comparison.₁
    from∘to x = trivial!

    to∘from : is-left-inverse from comparison.₁
    to∘from x = trivial!
```

Showing that the functor is essentially surjective is significantly more
complicated. We must show that we can recover a monoid from a List
algebra (a "fold"): We take the unit element to be the fold of the empty
list, and the binary operation $x \star y$ to be the fold of the list
$[x,y]$.

```agda
  it's-eso : is-split-eso comparison
  it's-eso (A , alg) = monoid , the-iso where
    open Algebra-on
    import Cat.Reasoning (Eilenberg-Moore (L∘R (Free-monoid⊣Forget {ℓ}))) as R

    monoid : Monoids ℓ .Ob
    monoid .fst = A
    monoid .snd .identity = alg .ν []
    monoid .snd ._⋆_ a b = alg .ν (a ∷ b ∷ [])
```

It suffices, through _incredibly_ tedious calculations, to show that
these data assembles into a monoid:

```agda
    monoid .snd .has-is-monoid = has-is-m where abstract
      has-is-m : is-monoid (alg .ν []) (monoid .snd ._⋆_)
      has-is-m .has-is-semigroup = record
        { has-is-magma = record { has-is-set = A .is-tr }
        ; associative  = λ {x} {y} {z} →
          alg .ν (⌜ x ⌝ ∷ alg .ν (y ∷ z ∷ []) ∷ [])               ≡˘⟨ ap¡ (happly (alg .ν-unit) x) ⟩
          alg .ν (alg .ν (x ∷ []) ∷ alg .ν (y ∷ z ∷ []) ∷ [])     ≡⟨ happly (alg .ν-mult) _ ⟩
          alg .ν (x ∷ y ∷ z ∷ [])                                 ≡˘⟨ happly (alg .ν-mult) _ ⟩
          alg .ν (alg .ν (x ∷ y ∷ []) ∷ ⌜ alg .ν (z ∷ []) ⌝ ∷ []) ≡⟨ ap! (happly (alg .ν-unit) z) ⟩
          alg .ν (alg .ν (x ∷ y ∷ []) ∷ z ∷ [])                   ∎
        }
      has-is-m .idl {x} =
        alg .ν (alg .ν [] ∷ ⌜ x ⌝ ∷ [])            ≡˘⟨ ap¡ (happly (alg .ν-unit) x) ⟩
        alg .ν (alg .ν [] ∷ alg .ν (x ∷ []) ∷ [])  ≡⟨ happly (alg .ν-mult) _ ⟩
        alg .ν (x ∷ [])                            ≡⟨ happly (alg .ν-unit) x ⟩
        x                                          ∎
      has-is-m .idr {x} =
        alg .ν (⌜ x ⌝ ∷ alg .ν [] ∷ [])            ≡˘⟨ ap¡ (happly (alg .ν-unit) x) ⟩
        alg .ν (alg .ν (x ∷ []) ∷ alg .ν [] ∷ [])  ≡⟨ happly (alg .ν-mult) _ ⟩
        alg .ν (x ∷ [])                            ≡⟨ happly (alg .ν-unit) x ⟩
        x                                          ∎
```

The most important lemma is that `folding`{.Agda ident=fold} a list
using this monoid recovers the original algebra multiplication, which we
can show by induction on the list:

```agda
    recover : ∀ x → fold _ x ≡ alg .ν x
    recover []       = refl
    recover (x ∷ xs) =
      alg .ν (x ∷ fold _ xs ∷ [])               ≡⟨ ap₂ (λ e f → alg .ν (e ∷ f ∷ [])) (sym (happly (alg .ν-unit) x)) (recover xs) ⟩
      alg .ν (alg .ν (x ∷ []) ∷ alg .ν xs ∷ []) ≡⟨ happly (alg .ν-mult) _ ⟩
      alg .ν (x ∷ xs ++ [])                     ≡⟨ ap (alg .ν) (++-idr _) ⟩
      alg .ν (x ∷ xs)                           ∎
```

We must then show that the image of this monoid under
`Comparison`{.Agda} is isomorphic to the original algebra. Fortunately,
this follows from the `recover`{.Agda} lemma above; The isomorphism
itself is given by the identity function in both directions, since the
recovered monoid has the same underlying type as the List-algebra!

```agda
    into : Algebra-hom _ (comparison.₀ monoid) (A , alg)
    into .hom = λ x → x
    into .preserves = funext (λ x → recover x ∙ ap (alg .ν) (sym (map-id x)))

    from : Algebra-hom _ (A , alg) (comparison.₀ monoid)
    from .hom = λ x → x
    from .preserves =
      funext (λ x → sym (recover x) ∙ ap (fold _) (sym (map-id x)))

    the-iso : comparison.₀ monoid R.≅ (A , alg)
    the-iso = R.make-iso into from trivial! trivial!
```
