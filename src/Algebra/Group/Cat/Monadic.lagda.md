# Monadicity of the category of groups

We prove that the category $\thecat{Groups}_\kappa$ is monadic over
$\Sets_\kappa$, or more specifically that the [[free group|free group
construction]] adjunction $F \dashv U$ is [monadic]. Rather than
appealing to a monadicity theorem, we show this directly by calculation.
This actually gives us a slightly sharper result, too: rather than
showing that the [comparison functor] is an equivalence, we show
directly that it is an isomorphism of categories. This doesn't exactly
matter since $\Sets_\kappa$ and $\thecat{Groups}_\kappa$ are both
[[univalent categories]], but it's interesting that it's easier to
construct an isomorphism than it is to construct an equivalence.

[monadic]: Cat.Functor.Adjoint.Monadic.html
[comparison functor]: Cat.Functor.Adjoint.Monadic.html#Comparison-EM

Let us abbreviate the [monad induced] by the [[free group|free group
construction]] adjunction by $T$. What we must show is that any
$T$-algebra structure on a set $G$ gives rise to a group structure on
$G$, and that this process is reversible: If $\nu$ is our original
algebra, applying our process then applying the comparison functor has
to give $\nu$ back.

  open Algebra-on alg

  mult : ∣ G ∣ → ∣ G ∣ → ∣ G ∣
  mult x y = ν (inc x ◆ inc y)
```

The thing to keep in mind is that a $T$-algebra structure is a way of
"folding" a word built up from generators in the set $G$, so that if we
build a word from two generators $x, y$, folding that should be the same
thing as a binary multiplication $xy$. That's the definition of the
induced multiplication structure! We now must show that this definition
is indeed a group structure, which is an incredibly boring calculation.

We now show that this construction fits into defining an inverse (on the
nose!) to the comparison functor. This is slightly easier than it sounds
like: We must show that the functor is [[fully faithful]], and that our
mapping above is indeed invertible.

Fully faithfulness is almost immediate: a homomorphism of $T$-algebras
$K(G) \to K(H)$ preserves underlying multiplication _because_ the
algebra structure of $K(G)$ (resp. $K(H)$) is defined in terms of that
multiplication. Since we leave the underlying map intact, and being a
homomorphism (either kind) is a property, the comparison functor is
fully faithful.

                                   (λ x → Grp.Grp↪Sets-is-faithful refl)
```

To show that the object mapping of the comparison functor is invertible,
we appeal to univalence. Since the _types_ are kept the same, it
suffices to show that passing between a multiplication and an algebra
map doesn't lose any information. This is immediate in one direction,
but the other direction is by induction on "words".
