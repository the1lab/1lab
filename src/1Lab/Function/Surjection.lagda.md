# Surjections {defines=surjection}

A function $f : A \to B$ is a **surjection** if, for each $b : B$, we
have $\| f^*b \|$: that is, all of its [[fibres]] are inhabited. Using
the notation for [[mere existence|merely]], we may write this as

$$
\forall (b : B),\ \exists (a : A),\ f(a) = b
$$.

which is evidently the familiar notion of surjection.

```agda
is-surjective : (A → B) → Type _
is-surjective f = ∀ b → ∥ fibre f b ∥
```

To abbreviate talking about surjections, we will use the notation $A
\epi B$, pronounced "$A$ **covers** $B$".

```agda
_↠_ : Type ℓ → Type ℓ' → Type (ℓ ⊔ ℓ')
A ↠ B = Σ[ f ∈ (A → B) ] is-surjective f
```

The notion of surjection is intimately connected with that of
[[quotient]], and in particular with the elimination principle into
[[propositions]]. We think of a surjection $A \to B$ as expressing that $B$
can be "glued together" by [[introducing paths between|path]] the
elements of $A$. Since any family of propositions respects these new
paths, we can prove a property of $B$ by showing it for the "generators"
coming from $A$:

```agda
is-surjective→elim-prop
  : (f : A ↠ B)
  → ∀ {ℓ} (P : B → Type ℓ)
  → (∀ x → is-prop (P x))
  → (∀ a → P (f .fst a))
  → ∀ x → P x
is-surjective→elim-prop (f , surj) P pprop pfa x =
  ∥-∥-rec (pprop _) (λ (x , p) → subst P p (pfa x)) (surj x)
```

When the type $B$ is a set, we can actually take this analogy all the
way to its conclusion: Given any cover $f : A \epi B$, we can produce an
equivalence between $B$ and the quotient of $A$ under the [[congruence]]
induced by $f$. See [[surjections are quotient maps]].

## Closure properties

The class of surjections contains the identity --- and thus every
equivalence --- and is closed under composition.

```agda
∘-is-surjective : ∘-closed is-surjective
∘-is-surjective {f = f} fs gs x = do
  (f*x , p) ← fs x
  (g*fx , q) ← gs f*x
  pure (g*fx , ap f q ∙ p)

id-is-surjective : is-surjective {A = A} id
id-is-surjective x = inc (x , refl)

is-equiv→is-surjective : {f : A → B} → is-equiv f → is-surjective f
is-equiv→is-surjective eqv x = inc (eqv .is-eqv x .centre)
```

Surjections also are closed under a weaker form of [[two-out-of-three]]:
if $f \circ g$ is surjective, then $f$ must also be surjective.

```agda
is-surjective-cancelr
  : {f : B → C} {g : A → B}
  → is-surjective (f ∘ g)
  → is-surjective f
is-surjective-cancelr {g = g} fgs c = do
  (fg*x , p) ← fgs c
  pure (g fg*x , p)
```

<!--
```agda
Equiv→Cover : A ≃ B → A ↠ B
Equiv→Cover f = f .fst , is-equiv→is-surjective (f .snd)
```
-->

## Relationship with equivalences

We have defined [[equivalences]] to be the maps with [[contractible]]
fibres; and surjections to be the maps with _inhabited_ fibres. It
follows that a surjection is an equivalence _precisely if_ its fibres
are also [[propositions]]; in other words, if it is an [[embedding]].

```agda
embedding-surjective→is-equiv
  : {f : A → B}
  → is-embedding f
  → is-surjective f
  → is-equiv f
embedding-surjective→is-equiv f-emb f-surj .is-eqv x = ∥-∥-out! do
  pt ← f-surj x
  pure $ is-prop∙→is-contr (f-emb x) pt
```

<!--
```agda

  : {f : A → B}
  → is-set B
  → injective f
  → is-surjective f
  → is-equiv f

  embedding-surjective→is-equiv (injective→is-embedding b-set _ f-inj)

injective-surjective→is-equiv!

  → is-equiv f
injective-surjective→is-equiv! =
  injective-surjective→is-equiv (hlevel 2)
```

## Surjectivity and images

A map $f : A \to B$ is surjective if and only if the inclusion of the
image of $f$ into $B$ is an [[equivalence]].

```agda
surjective-iff-image-equiv
  : ∀ {f : A → B}
  → is-surjective f ≃ is-equiv {A = image f} fst
```

First, note that the fibre of the inclusion of the image of $f$ at $b$
is the [[propositional truncation]] of the fibre of $f$ at $b$, by
construction. Asking for this inclusion to be an equivalence is the same as
asking for those fibres to be [[contractible]], which thus amounts to
asking for the fibres of $f$ to be [[merely]] inhabited, which is the
definition of $f$ being surjective.

```agda
surjective-iff-image-equiv {A = A} {B = B} {f = f} =
  Equiv.inverse $
    is-equiv fst                            ≃⟨ is-equiv≃fibre-is-contr ⟩
    (∀ b → is-contr (fibre fst b))          ≃⟨ Π-ap-cod (λ b → is-hlevel-ap 0 (Fibre-equiv _ _)) ⟩
    (∀ b → is-contr (∃[ a ∈ A ] (f a ≡ b))) ≃⟨ Π-ap-cod (λ b → is-prop→is-contr-iff-inhabited (hlevel 1)) ⟩
    (∀ b → ∃[ a ∈ A ] (f a ≡ b))            ≃⟨⟩
    is-surjective f                         ≃∎
```

# Split surjective functions

:::{.definition #surjective-splitting}
A **surjective splitting** of a function $f : A \to B$ consists of a designated
element of the fibre $f^*b$ for each $b : B$.
:::

```agda
surjective-splitting : (A → B) → Type _
surjective-splitting f = ∀ b → fibre f b
```

Note that unlike "being surjective", a surjective splitting of $f$ is a *structure*
on $f$, not a property. This difference becomes particularly striking when we
look at functions into [[contractible]] types: if $B$ is contractible,
then the type of surjective splittings of a function $f : A \to B$ is equivalent to $A$.

```agda
private
  split-surjective-is-structure
    : (f : A → B)
    → is-contr B
    → surjective-splitting f ≃ A
```

First, recall that dependent functions $(a : A) \to B(a)$ out of a contractible type are
equivalent to an element of $B$ at the centre of contraction, so $(b : B) \to f^*(b)$ is
equivalent to an element of the fibre of $f$ at the centre of contraction of $B$. Moreover,
the type of paths in $B$ is also contractible, so that fibre is equivalent to $A$.

```agda
  split-surjective-is-structure {A = A} f B-contr =
    (∀ b → fibre f b)         ≃⟨ Π-contr-eqv B-contr ⟩
    fibre f (B-contr .centre) ≃⟨ Σ-contr-snd (λ _ → Path-is-hlevel 0 B-contr) ⟩
    A                         ≃∎
```

In light of this, we provide the following definition.

:::{.definition #split-surjective}
A function $f : A \to B$ is **split surjective** if there merely exists a
surjective splitting of $f$.
:::

```agda
is-split-surjective : (A → B) → Type _
is-split-surjective f = ∥ surjective-splitting f ∥
```

Every split surjective map is surjective.

```agda
is-split-surjective→is-surjective : is-split-surjective f → is-surjective f
is-split-surjective→is-surjective f-split-surj b = do
  f-splitting ← f-split-surj
  pure (f-splitting b)
```

Note that we do not have a converse to this constructively: the statement that
every surjective function between [[sets]] splits is [[equivalent to the axiom of choice|axiom-of-choice]]!

## Split surjective functions and sections

The type of surjective splittings of a function $f : A \to B$ is equivalent
to the type of sections of $f$, i.e. functions $s : B \to A$ with $f \circ s = \id$.

```agda
section≃surjective-splitting
  : (f : A → B)
  → (Σ[ s ∈ (B → A) ] is-right-inverse s f) ≃ surjective-splitting f
```

Somewhat surprisingly, this is an immediate consequence of the fact that
sigma types distribute over pi types!

```agda
section≃surjective-splitting {A = A} {B = B} f =
  (Σ[ s ∈ (B → A) ] ((x : B) → f (s x) ≡ x)) ≃˘⟨ Σ-Π-distrib ⟩
  ((b : B) → Σ[ a ∈ A ] f a ≡ b)             ≃⟨⟩
  surjective-splitting f                     ≃∎
```

This means that a function $f$ is split surjective if and only if there
[[merely]] exists some section of $f$.

```agda
exists-section-iff-split-surjective
  : (f : A → B)
  → (∃[ s ∈ (B → A) ] is-right-inverse s f) ≃ is-split-surjective f
exists-section-iff-split-surjective f =
  ∥-∥-ap (section≃surjective-splitting f)
```

## Closure properties of split surjective functions

Like their non-split counterparts, split surjective functions are closed under composition.

```agda
∘-surjective-splitting : ∘-closed surjective-splitting
∘-is-split-surjective : ∘-closed is-split-surjective
```

<details>
<summary> The proof is essentially identical to the non-split case.
</summary>

```agda
∘-surjective-splitting {f = f} f-split g-split c =
  let (f*c , p) = f-split c
      (g*f*c , q) = g-split f*c
  in g*f*c , ap f q ∙ p

∘-is-split-surjective fs gs = ⦇ ∘-surjective-splitting fs gs ⦈
```
</details>

Every equivalence can be equipped with a surjective splitting, and
is thus split surjective.

```agda
is-equiv→surjective-splitting
  : is-equiv f
  → surjective-splitting f

is-equiv→is-split-surjective
  : is-equiv f
  → is-split-surjective f
```

This follows immediately from the definition of equivalences: if the
type of fibres is contractible, then we can pluck the element we need
out of the centre of contraction!

```agda
is-equiv→surjective-splitting f-equiv b =
  f-equiv .is-eqv b .centre

is-equiv→is-split-surjective f-equiv =
  pure (is-equiv→surjective-splitting f-equiv)
```

Split surjective functions also satisfy left two-out-of-three.

```agda
surjective-splitting-cancelr
  : surjective-splitting (f ∘ g)
  → surjective-splitting f

is-split-surjective-cancelr
  : is-split-surjective (f ∘ g)
  → is-split-surjective f
```

<details>
<summary>These proofs are also essentially identical to the non-split versions.
</summary>

```agda
surjective-splitting-cancelr {g = g} fg-split c =
  let (fg*c , p) = fg-split c
  in g fg*c , p

is-split-surjective-cancelr fg-split =
  map surjective-splitting-cancelr fg-split
```
</details>

A function is an equivalence if and only if it is a split-surjective
[[embedding]].

```agda
embedding-split-surjective≃is-equiv
  : {f : A → B}
  → (is-embedding f × is-split-surjective f) ≃ is-equiv f
embedding-split-surjective≃is-equiv {f = f} =
  prop-ext!
    (λ (f-emb , f-split-surj) →
      embedding-surjective→is-equiv
        f-emb
        (is-split-surjective→is-surjective f-split-surj))
    (λ f-equiv → is-equiv→is-embedding f-equiv , is-equiv→is-split-surjective f-equiv)
```

# Surjectivity and connectedness

If $f : A \to B$ is a function out of a [[contractible]] type $A$,
then $f$ is surjective if and only if $B$ is a [[pointed connected type]], where
the basepoint of $B$ is given by $f$ applied to the centre of contraction of $A$.

```agda
contr-dom-surjective-iff-connected-cod
  : ∀ {f : A → B}
  → (A-contr : is-contr A)
  → is-surjective f ≃ ((x : B) → ∥ x ≡ f (A-contr .centre) ∥)
```

To see this, note that the fibre of $f$ over $x$ is equivalent
to the type of paths $x = f(a_{\bullet})$, where $a_{\bullet}$ is the centre
of contraction of $A$.

```agda
contr-dom-surjective-iff-connected-cod {A = A} {B = B} {f = f} A-contr =
  Π-ap-cod (λ b → ∥-∥-ap (Σ-contr-fst A-contr ∙e sym-equiv))
```

This correspondence is not a coincidence: surjective maps fit into
a larger family of maps known as [[connected maps]]. In particular,
a map is surjective exactly when it is (-1)-connected, and this lemma is
a special case of `is-n-connected-point`{.Agda}.
