# Sets is regular

We can prove that the category of $\Sets$ is regular by investigating
the relationship between [surjections], regular epimorphisms, and
arbitrary epimorphisms. Fortunately, they _all_ coincide, and we already
[know] that $\Sets$ is [[finitely complete]], so it only remains to show
that morphisms have an epi-mono factorisation, and that epimorphy is
stable under pullbacks.

[surjections]: Data.Set.Surjection.html#surjections-are-epic
[know]: Cat.Instances.Sets.Complete.html#finite-set-limits

```agda
Sets-regular : ∀ {ℓ} → is-regular (Sets ℓ)
Sets-regular .has-is-lex = Sets-finitely-complete
```

For the factorisation, we go with the pre-existing notion of
`image`{.Agda}, not only because we're trying to compute an _image_
factorisation, but because there is a natural surjection $a \epi \im(f)$
and an embedding $\im(f) \mono b$.

```agda
Sets-regular .factor {a} {b} f = λ where
  .mediating → el! (image f)
  .mediate x → (f x) , inc (x , refl)
  .forget    → fst

  .mediate∈E → inc (is-regular-epi→is-strong-epi (Sets _) {a} {el! (image f)} _
    (surjective→regular-epi _ _ _ λ {
      (x , y) → ∥-∥-rec squash (λ { (pre , p) → inc (pre , Σ-prop-path! p) }) y }))

  .forget∈M  → inc (embedding→monic (Subset-proj-embedding (λ _ → squash)))
  .factors   → refl
```

It additionally suffices to verify this only for our choice of pullbacks
(rather than arbitrary pullback squares), for which the following
calculation does perfectly:

```agda
Sets-regular .stable =
  canonically-stable
    (λ {a} {b} → is-strong-epi (Sets _) {a} {b}) Sets-is-category Sets-pullbacks
    λ {a} {b} {c} f g (f-epi , _) →
    let
      rem₁ : is-surjective f
      rem₁ = epi→surjective a b f λ {c} → f-epi {c}

      T : Set _
      T = Sets-pullbacks {A = c} {a} {b} g f .Pullback.apex

      pb : ∣ T ∣ → ∣ c ∣
      pb = Sets-pullbacks {A = c} {a} {b} g f .Pullback.p₁

      rem₂ : is-surjective pb
      rem₂ x = do
        (f^*fx , p) ← rem₁ (g x)
        pure ((x , f^*fx , sym p) , refl)
    in
      is-regular-epi→is-strong-epi (Sets _) {a = el! _} {c} _
        (surjective→regular-epi _ _ _ rem₂)
```
