# Strong monomorphisms {defines="strong-mono strong-monomorphism"}

A **strong monomorphism** is a [[monomorphism]] that is [[right orthogonal]]
to every [[epimorphism]]. Note that strong monomorphisms are the formal dual of
[[strong epimorphisms]]. Explicitly, $m : c \mono d$ is a strong mono
if every commutative square of the form

~~~{.quiver}
\begin{tikzcd}
  a && b \\
  \\
  c && d
  \arrow["e", two heads, from=1-1, to=1-3]
  \arrow["u"', from=1-1, to=3-1]
  \arrow["v", from=1-3, to=3-3]
  \arrow["m"', tail, from=3-1, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}
~~~

has a contractible space of lifts $b \to c$.

```agda
is-strong-mono : ∀ {c d} → Hom c d → Type _
is-strong-mono f = is-monic f × (∀ {a b} (e : a ↠ b) → m⊥m C (e .mor) f)
```

As it turns out, the contractibility requirement is redundant, as every
lift of a mono is unique.

```agda
lifts→is-strong-mono
  : ∀ {c d} {f : Hom c d}
  → is-monic f
  → (∀ {a b} (e : a ↠ b) {u v} → v ∘ e .mor ≡ f ∘ u
    → Lifting C (e .mor) f u v)
  → is-strong-mono f
lifts→is-strong-mono monic lift-it =
  monic , λ e →
  right-monic-lift→orthogonal C (e .mor) monic (lift-it e)
```

This condition seems somewhat arbitrary, so let's take a second to do
some exposition. First, note that in $\Sets$, every mono is strong.
The key insight here is that epis are surjections, and monos are
[[embeddings]]. In particular, suppose that $f : A \epi B$ is
some surjection and $m : C \to D$ is some embedding, and $u : A \to C$,
$v : B \to D$ are a pair of arbitrary maps; our job is to build a function
$B \to C$. Now, $f$ is a surjection, so we know that each fibre $f^{-1}(b)$
is *merely* inhabited. However, $m$ is an embedding, so its fibres
are [[propositions]]: therefore, we can eliminate from the truncation of $f^{-1}(b)$
to $m^{-1}(v(b))$ via $u$. This suggests that we ought to think of strong
monomorphisms as a categorical generalization of maps with propositional
fibres.

With that bit of intuition out of the way, we can proceed to prove some
basic facts. Let's start by showing that every isomorphism is a strong mono.

```agda
invertible→strong-mono
  : ∀ {a b} {f : Hom a b} → is-invertible f → is-strong-mono f
```

The argument here is quite straightforward: every iso is monic, and
isos are right orthogonal to every map.

```agda
invertible→strong-mono f-inv =
  invertible→monic f-inv , λ e →
  invertible→right-orthogonal C (e .mor) f-inv
```

Next, let's show that strong monos compose. This is completely dual
to the proof that [strong epis compose], so we direct the reader there
for exposition.

```agda
strong-mono-∘
  : ∀ {a b c} (f : Hom b c) (g : Hom a b)
  → is-strong-mono f
  → is-strong-mono g
  → is-strong-mono (f ∘ g)
strong-mono-∘ f g (f-mono , f-str) (g-mono , g-str) =
  lifts→is-strong-mono (monic-∘ f-mono g-mono) λ e → ∘r-lifts-against C
    (orthogonal→lifts-against C (f-str e))
    (orthogonal→lifts-against C (g-str e))
```

Like their non-strong counterparts, strong monomorphisms satisfy a
left cancellation property. This is dual to the proof that [strong epis
cancel], so we omit the details.

  → is-strong-mono (f ∘ g)
  → is-strong-mono g

  where
    g-mono : is-monic g
    g-mono = monic-cancell fg-mono

    g-str : ∀ {a b} (e : a ↠ b) {u v} → v ∘ e .mor ≡ g ∘ u → _
    g-str e {u} {v} ve=gu =
      let (w , we=u , fgw=fv) = fg-str e (extendr ve=gu) .centre
      in w , we=u , e .epic (g ∘ w) v (pullr we=u ∙ sym ve=gu)
```

If a morphism is both strong monic and epic, then it is orthogonal to
itself, and thus invertible.

```agda
strong-mono+epi→invertible
  : ∀ {a b} {f : Hom a b} → is-strong-mono f → is-epic f → is-invertible f
strong-mono+epi→invertible {f = f} (_ , strong) epi =
  self-orthogonal→invertible C f (strong (make-epi f epi))
```
