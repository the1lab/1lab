# Conservative adjoint functors {defines="conservative-adjoint-functors"}

This short note proves that a [[right adjoint]] $R : \cD \to \cC$ from
a [[finitely complete]] category is [[conservative]] if and only if the
counit of the adjunction is a componentwise [[strong epimorphism]]. This
is a particularly useful result, as helps us satisfy one of the hypotheses
of the [[crude monadicity theorem]].

For the forward direction, suppose that $D$ is finitely complete, and $R$
is conservative; we need to show that $\eps_{X}$ is a strong epi. Because
$D$ is finitely complete, it suffices to prove that $\eps_{X}$ is an
[[extremal epi]]. Let $m \circ f$ be a factorization of $\eps_{X}$
with $m$ [[monic]]; we now need to show that $\eps_{X}$ is invertible.
However, $R$ is conservative, so it is sufficient to show that $R(m)$ is
invertible.

We will do this by showing that is monic $R(m)$ and has a section.
The former is immediate, as [[right adjoints preserve monos]]. The latter
will require a bit more mork, but only just: the [[adjunct]] of $f$
is a suitable candidate, and a quick calculation verifies that it is
indeed a section.

```agda
  right-conservative→counit-strong-epi
    : Finitely-complete D
    → is-conservative R
    → ∀ {x} → D.is-strong-epi (ε x)
  right-conservative→counit-strong-epi D-fc R-cons =
    D.is-extremal-epi→is-strong-epi D-fc λ m f ε=mf →
    R-cons $
    C.has-section+monic→invertible
      (C.make-section (L-adjunct L⊣R f) (R.pulll (sym ε=mf) ∙ zag))
      (right-adjoint→preserves-monos R L⊣R (D.monic m))
```

On to the reverse direction. Suppose that the counit is a strong epi,
and let $f : \cD(X,Y)$ such that $R(f)$ is invertible; our goal is to
show that $f$ is invertible. We shall do this by showing that $f$ is both
a mono and a strong epi.

```agda
  counit-strong-epi→right-conservative
    : (∀ {x} → D.is-strong-epi (ε x))
    → is-conservative R
  counit-strong-epi→right-conservative ε-strong-epi {x} {y} {f} Rf-inv =
    D.strong-epi+mono→invertible
      f-strong-epi
      f-monic
    where
```

The case where $f$ is monic is the easier of the two. Let $g, h : \cD(A,X)$
such that $f \circ g = g \circ h$; our aim is to show that $f = g$. By our
assumptions, $\eps$ is a strong epi (and thus an epi), so it suffices
to show that $g \circ eps = h \circ \eps$. By naturality, this is equivalent
to showing that $eps \circ L(R(g)) = \eps \circ L(R(h))$. Finally,
$R(f)$ is invertible, so it must be monic: this means that it suffices
to show that $R(f) \circ R(g) = R(f) \circ R(h)$, which follows directly
from our hypothesis that $f \circ g = f \circ h$.

```agda
      f-monic : D.is-monic f
      f-monic g h fg=fh =
        ε-strong-epi .fst g h $
        counit.viewl $
        ap L.₁ $
        C.invertible→monic Rf-inv (R.F₁ g) (R.F₁ h) (R.weave fg=fh)
```

Luckily, proving that $f$ is a strong epi is not that much harder.
Strong epis have a left-cancellation property, so it is sufficient
to show that $f \circ \eps$ is a strong epi. By naturality, this is
equivalent to showing that $\eps \circ L(R(f))$ is a strong epi.
Strong epis compose, and $\eps$ is a strong epi by our assumptions,
so all that remains is to show that $L(R(f))$ is a strong epi.
This is immediate: $L(R(f))$ is invertible, and invertible maps are
strong epis.

```agda
      f-strong-epi : D.is-strong-epi f
      f-strong-epi =
        D.strong-epi-cancelr f (ε x) $
        D.subst-is-strong-epi (counit.is-natural x y f) $
        D.strong-epi-∘ (ε y) (L.₁ (R.₁ f))
          ε-strong-epi
          (D.invertible→strong-epi (L.F-map-invertible Rf-inv))
```
