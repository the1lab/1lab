# Free cocompletions {defines="free-cocompletion"}

Let $\cC$ be a [$\kappa$-small] precategory. It, broadly speaking,
will not be cocomplete. Suppose that we're interested in passing from
$\cC$ to a cocomplete category; How might we go about this in a
universal way?

To substantiate this problem, it helps to picture a _geometric_ case.
We'll take $\cC = \Delta$, the category of non-empty finite ordinals
and monotonic functions. The objects and maps in this category satisfy
equations which let us, broadly speaking, think of its objects as
"abstract (higher-dimensional) triangles", or _simplices_. For instance,
there are (families) of maps $[n]\to[n+1]$, exhibiting an
$n$-dimensional simplex as a face in an $(n+1)$-dimensional simplex.

Now, this category does _not_ have all colimits. For example, we should
be able to the red and blue triangles in the diagram below to obtain a
"square", but you'll find no such object in $\Delta$.

\[\begin{tikzcd}
  \bullet && \bullet \\
  \\
  \bullet && \bullet
  \arrow[color={rgb,255:red,92;green,92;blue,214}, from=1-1, to=3-3]
  \arrow[color={rgb,255:red,92;green,92;blue,214}, from=3-1, to=1-1]
  \arrow[color={rgb,255:red,92;green,92;blue,214}, from=3-1, to=3-3]
  \arrow[color={rgb,255:red,214;green,92;blue,92}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
  \arrow[color={rgb,255:red,214;green,92;blue,92}, from=1-3, to=3-3]
  \arrow[shift left=1, color={rgb,255:red,214;green,92;blue,92}, from=1-1, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
~~~

Universally embedding $\Delta$ in a cocomplete category should then
result in a "category of shapes built by gluing simplices"; Formally,
these are called _simplicial sets_. It turns out that the [Yoneda
embedding] satisfies the property we're looking for: Any functor $F :
\cC \to \cD$ into a cocomplete category $\cD$ factors as

$$
\cC \xto{\yo} \psh(\cC) \xto{\Lan_\yo F} \cD\text{,}
$$

where $\Lan_\yo F$ is the [[left Kan extension]] of $F$ along the Yoneda
embedding, and furthermore this extension preserves colimits. While this
may sound like a _lot_ to prove, it turns out that the tide has already
risen above it: Everything claimed above follows from the general theory
of Kan extensions.
