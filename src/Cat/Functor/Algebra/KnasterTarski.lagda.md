# The Knaster-Tarski fixpoint theorem {defines="knaster-tarski"}

The **Knaster-Tarski theorem** gives a recipe for constructing [[initial]]
[[F-algebras]] in [[complete categories]].

The big idea is that if a category $\cC$ is complete, then we can construct
an initial algebra of a functor $F$ by taking a limit $\rm{Fix}$ over the forgetful
functor $\pi : \FAlg{F} \to \cC$ from the category of $F$-algebras:
the universal property of such a limit let us construct an algebra
$F(\rm{Fix}) \to \rm{Fix}$, and the projections out of $\rm{Fix}$ let
us establish that $\rm{Fix}$ is the initial algebra.

Unfortunately, this limit is a bit too ambitious. If we examine the universe
levels involved, we will quickly notice that this argument requires $\cC$
to admit limits indexed by the \emph{objects} of $\cC$, which in the presence
of excluded middle means that $\cC$ must be a preorder.

This problem of overly ambitious limits is similar to the one encountered
in the naïve [[adjoint functor theorem]], so we can use a similar technique
to repair our proof. In particular, we will impose a variant of the
**solution set condition** on the category of $F$-algebras that ensures
that the limit we end up computing is determined by a small amount of data,
which lets us relax our large-completeness requirement.

More precisely, we will require that the category of $F$-algebras has a
small [[weakly initial family]] of algebras. This means that we need:

- A family $\alpha_i : F(A_i) \to A_i$ of $F$ algebras indexed by a
  small set $I$, such that;
- For every $F$-algebra $\beta : F(B) \to B$, there (merely) exists an $i : I$
  along with a $F$-algebra morphism $A_i \to B$.

  {o ℓ} {C : Precategory o ℓ}
  (F : Functor C C)
  where
  open Cat.Reasoning C
  open Functor F
  open ∫Hom
```

Once we have a solution set, the theorem pops open like a walnut submerged
in water:

* First, $\cC$ is small-complete, so the category of $F$-algebras must also
  be small-complete, as [[limits of $F$-algebras]] are computed by limits
  in $\cC$.
* In particular, the category of $F$-algebras has all small [[equalisers]],
  so we can upgrade our weakly initial family to an [[initial object]].

```agda
  solution-set→initial-algebra
    : ∀ {κ} {Idx : Type κ} ⦃ _ : ∀ {n} → H-Level Idx (2 + n) ⦄
    → (Aᵢ : Idx → FAlg.Ob F)
    → is-complete κ (ℓ ⊔ κ) C
    → is-weak-initial-fam (FAlg F) Aᵢ
    → Initial (FAlg F)
  solution-set→initial-algebra Aᵢ complete soln-set =
    is-complete-weak-initial→initial (FAlg F)
      Aᵢ
      (FAlg-is-complete complete F)
      soln-set
```

We can obtain the more familiar form of the Knaster-Tarski theorem by
applying [[Lambek's lemma]] to the resulting initial algebra.

```agda
  solution-set→fixpoint
    : ∀ {κ} {Idx : Type κ} ⦃ _ : ∀ {n} → H-Level Idx (2 + n) ⦄
    → (Aᵢ : Idx → FAlg.Ob F)
    → is-complete κ (ℓ ⊔ κ) C
    → is-weak-initial-fam (FAlg F) Aᵢ
    → Σ[ Fix ∈ Ob ] (F₀ Fix ≅ Fix)
  solution-set→fixpoint Aᵢ complete soln-set =
    bot .fst , invertible→iso (bot .snd) (lambek F (bot .snd) has-is-init)
    where open Initial (solution-set→initial-algebra Aᵢ complete soln-set)
```

## Knaster-Tarski for sup-lattices

<!--
```agda
module _
  {o ℓ} (P : Poset o ℓ)
  (f : Monotone P P)
  where
  open Poset P
  open ∫Hom
```
-->

The "traditional" Knaster-Tarski theorem states that every [[monotone endomap|monotone-map]]
on a [[poset]] $P$ with all [[greatest lower bounds]] has a [[least fixpoint]].
In the presence of [[propositional resizing]], this theorem follows as a corollary of
our previous theorem.

```agda
  complete→least-fixpoint
    : (∀ {I : Type o} → (k : I → Ob) → Glb P k)
    → Least-fixpoint P f
  complete→least-fixpoint glbs = least-fixpoint where
```

<!--
```agda
    open Cat.Reasoning (poset→category P) using (_≅_; to; from)
    open is-least-fixpoint
    open Least-fixpoint
```
-->

The key is that resizing lets us prove the solution set condition with
respect to the size of the underlying set of $P$, as we can resize away
the proofs that $f x \leq x$.

```agda
    Idx : Type o
    Idx = Σ[ x ∈ Ob ] (□ (f · x ≤ x))

    soln : Idx → Σ[ x ∈ Ob ] (f · x ≤ x)
    soln (x , lt) = x , (□-out! lt)

    is-soln-set : is-weak-initial-fam (FAlg (monotone→functor f)) soln
    is-soln-set (x , lt) = inc ((x , inc lt) , ∫hom ≤-refl prop!)
```

Moreover, $P$ has all [[greatest lower bounds]], so it is `complete as a
category`{.Agda ident=glbs→complete}. This lets us invoke the general
Knaster-Tarski theorem to get an initial $f$-algebra.

```agda
    initial : Initial (FAlg (monotone→functor f))
    initial =
      solution-set→initial-algebra (monotone→functor f)
        soln
        (glbs→complete glbs)
        is-soln-set
```

Finally, we can inline the proof of [[Lambek's lemma]] to show that this
initial algebra gives the least fixpoint of $f$!

```agda
    open Initial initial

    least-fixpoint : Least-fixpoint P f
    least-fixpoint .fixpoint = bot .fst
    least-fixpoint .has-least-fixpoint .fixed = ≤-antisym
      (bot .snd)
      (¡ {x = f .hom (bot .fst) , f .pres-≤ (bot .snd)} .fst)
    least-fixpoint .has-least-fixpoint .least x fx=x =
      ¡ {x = x , ≤-refl' fx=x} .fst
```
