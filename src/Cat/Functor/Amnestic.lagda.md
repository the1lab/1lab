# Amnestic functors {defines="amnestic"}

The notion of **amnestic functor** was introduced by Adámek, Herrlich
and Strecker in their book "The Joy of Cats"^[Cats are, indeed, very
joyful] as a way to make precise the vibes-based notion of **forgetful
functor**. Classically, the definition reads

> A functor $F : \cC \to \cD$ is **amnestic** if an isomorphism
$f$ _is an identity_ whenever $Ff$ is,

but what does it mean for an isomorphism $f : a \cong b$ to _be an
identity_? The obvious translation would be that $f$ comes from an
identification $a \equiv b$ of objects, but this is just rephrasing the
condition that $\cC$ is univalent, whereas we want a condition on the
_functor_ $F$. So, we define:

An isomorphism $f : a \cong b$ **is an identity** if it is an identity
in the total space of `Hom`{.Agda}, i.e. if there is an object $c : \cC$
s.t. $(c, c, \id) = (a, b, f)$ in the type $\Sigma_a \Sigma_b (a \to b)$.
Every isomorphism in a [[univalent category]] is an identity, since we can
take $c = a$, and the identification in `Arrows`{.Agda} follows from
univalence.

```agda
module _ (F : Functor C D) where
  private
    module C = Cat C
    module D = Cat D
    module F = Func F
```
-->

Let $f$ be an identity, i.e. it is such that $(a, b, f) \cong (c, c,
\id)$. Any functor $F$ induces an identification $(Fa, Fb, Ff) \cong
(Fc, Fc, id)$, meaning that it _preserves being an identity_. A functor
is **amnestic** if it additionally _reflects_ being an identity: the
natural map we have implicitly defined above (called `action`{.Agda}) is
an equivalence.

```agda
  action : ∀ {a b : C.Ob} (f : C.Hom a b)
         → Σ[ c ∈ C ] (Hom→Arrow C (C.id {x = c}) ≡ Hom→Arrow C f)
         → Σ[ c ∈ D ] (Hom→Arrow D (D.id {x = c}) ≡ Hom→Arrow D (F.₁ f))
  action f (c , p) = F.₀ c , q where
    q : Hom→Arrow D D.id ≡ Hom→Arrow D (F.₁ f)
    q i .fst = F.₀ (p i .fst)
    q i .snd .fst = F.₀ (p i .snd .fst)
    q i .snd .snd = hcomp (∂ i) λ where
      j (j = i0) → F.₁ (p i .snd .snd)
      j (i = i1) → F.₁ f
      j (i = i0) → F.F-id j

  is-amnestic : Type _
  is-amnestic = ∀ {a b : C.Ob} (f : C.Hom a b)
              → C.is-invertible f → is-equiv (action f)
```

# Who cares?

The amnestic functors are interesting to consider in HoTT because they
are exactly those that _reflect univalence_: If $F : \cC \to \cD$
is an amnestic functor and $\cD$ is a univalent category, then
$\cC$ is univalent, too!

```agda
  reflect-category : is-category D → is-amnestic → is-category C
  reflect-category d-cat forget = record { to-path = A≡B ; to-path-over = q } where
    module _ {A} {B} isom where
      isom' = F-map-iso F isom
```

For suppose that $i : a \cong b \in \cC$ is an isomorphism. $F$
preserves this isomorphism, meaning we have an iso $Fi : Fa \cong Fb$,
now in $\cD$. But because $\cD$ is a univalent category, $Fi$ is
an identity, and by $F$'s amnesia, so is $i$.

```agda
      p : Σ[ c ∈ C ] Path (Arrows C) (c , c , C.id) (A , B , isom .C.to)
      p = equiv→inverse (forget (isom .C.to) (C.iso→invertible isom)) $ F.₀ A ,
        Arrows-path D refl (d-cat .to-path isom')
          (Univalent.Hom-pathp-reflr-iso d-cat (D.idr _))
```

Unfolding, we have an object $x : \cC$ and an identification $p : (x,
x, \id) \equiv (a, b, i)$. We may construct an identification $p' :
a \cong b$ from the components of $p$, and this induces an
identification $\id \equiv i$ over $p'$ in a straightforward way.
We're done!

```agda
      A≡B = sym (ap fst (p .snd)) ∙ ap (fst ⊙ snd) (p .snd)

      q : PathP (λ i → A C.≅ A≡B i) C.id-iso isom
      q = C.≅-pathp refl A≡B $ Hom-pathp-reflr C $
           C.idr _
        ·· path→to-∙ C _ _
        ·· ap₂ C._∘_ refl (sym (path→to-sym C (ap fst (p .snd))))
         ∙ Hom-pathp-id C (ap (snd ⊙ snd) (p .snd))
```
