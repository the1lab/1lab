# Initial objects as limits

This module provides a characterisation of [[initial objects]] as
[[*limits*]], rather than as [[colimits]]. Namely, while an initial
object is the *co*limit of the empty diagram, it is the *limit* of the
identity functor, considered as a diagram.

Since the identity functor on $\cC$ has $\cC$ itself as a domain,
computing its limit by general means is usually infeasible. However,
*if* we have such a limit handy, then we know that $\cC$ has an initial
object. Conversely, if $\cC$ has an initial object, then, as a
triviality, we can say that it admits at least one "large" limit.
