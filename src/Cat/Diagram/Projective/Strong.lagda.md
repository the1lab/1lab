# Strong projective objects

:::{.definition #strong-projective-object alias="strong-projective"}
Let $\cC$ be a precategory. An object $P : \cC$ is a
**strong projective object** if it has the left-lifting property against
[[strong epimorphisms]].

More explicitly, $P$ is a strong projective object if for every
morphism $p : P \to Y$ and strong epi $e : X \epi Y$, there merely exists
a $s : P \to X$ such that $e \circ s = p$, as in the following diagram:

~~~{.quiver}
\begin{tikzcd}
  && X \\
  \\
  P && Y
  \arrow["e", two heads, from=1-3, to=3-3]
  \arrow["\exists s", dashed, from=3-1, to=1-3]
  \arrow["p"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}
~~~

```agda
is-strong-projective : (P : Ob) → Type _
is-strong-projective P =
  ∀ {X Y} (p : Hom P Y) (e : Hom X Y)
  → is-strong-epi e
  → ∃[ s ∈ Hom P X ] (e ∘ s ≡ p)
```

::: warning
Being a strong projective object is actually a weaker condition than
being a [[projective object]]: strong projectives only need to lift
against strong epis, whereas projectives need to lift against *all* epis.

## A functorial definition

Like their non-strong counterparts, we can give a functorial definition of
strong projectives. In particular, an object $P : \cC$ is a strong projective
if and only if the $\hom$-functor $\cC(P,-)$ preserves strong epimorphisms.

```agda
preserves-strong-epis→strong-projective
  : ∀ {P}
  → preserves-strong-epis (Hom-from C P)
  → is-strong-projective P

strong-projective→preserves-strong-epis
  : ∀ {P}
  → is-strong-projective P
  → preserves-strong-epis (Hom-from C P)
```

<details>
<summary>These proofs are essentially the same as the corresponding
ones for projective objects, so we omit the details.

```agda
preserves-strong-epis→strong-projective {P = P} hom-epi {X = X} {Y = Y} p e e-strong =
  epi→surjective (el! (Hom P X)) (el! (Hom P Y))
    (e ∘_)
    (λ {c} → hom-epi e-strong .fst {c = c})
    p

strong-projective→preserves-strong-epis {P = P} pro {X} {Y} {f = f} f-strong =
    surjective→strong-epi (el! (Hom P X)) (el! (Hom P Y)) (f ∘_) $ λ p →
    pro p f f-strong

## Closure of strong projectives

Like projective objects, strong projectives are closed under coproducts
indexed by [[set-projective]] types and retracts.

```agda
indexed-coproduct-strong-projective
  : ∀ {κ} {Idx : Type κ}
  → {P : Idx → Ob} {∐P : Ob} {ι : ∀ i → Hom (P i) ∐P}
  → is-set-projective Idx ℓ
  → (∀ i → is-strong-projective (P i))
  → is-indexed-coproduct C P ι
  → is-strong-projective ∐P

retract→strong-projective
  : ∀ {R P}
  → is-strong-projective P
  → (s : Hom R P)
  → has-retract s
  → is-strong-projective R
```

<details>
<summary>These proofs are more or less identical to the corresponding
ones for projective objects.
</summary>
```agda
indexed-coproduct-strong-projective {P = P} {ι = ι} Idx-pro P-pro coprod {X = X} {Y = Y} p e e-strong = do
  s ← Idx-pro
        (λ i → Σ[ sᵢ ∈ Hom (P i) X ] (e ∘ sᵢ ≡ p ∘ ι i)) (λ i → hlevel 2)
        (λ i → P-pro i (p ∘ ι i) e e-strong)
  pure (match (λ i → s i .fst) , unique₂ (λ i → pullr commute ∙ s i .snd))
  where open is-indexed-coproduct coprod

retract→strong-projective P-pro s r p e e-strong = do
  (t , t-factor) ← P-pro (p ∘ r .retract) e e-strong
  pure (t ∘ s , pulll t-factor ∙ cancelr (r .is-retract))
```
</details>

Moreover, if $\cC$ has a [[zero object]] and a strong projective
coproduct $\coprod_{I} P_i$ indexed by a [[discrete]] type, then
each component of the coproduct is a strong projective.

```agda
zero+indexed-coproduct-strong-projective→strong-projective
  : ∀ {κ} {Idx : Type κ} ⦃ Idx-Discrete : Discrete Idx ⦄
  → {P : Idx → Ob} {∐P : Ob} {ι : ∀ i → Hom (P i) ∐P}
  → Zero C
  → is-indexed-coproduct C P ι
  → is-strong-projective ∐P
  → ∀ i → is-strong-projective (P i)
```

<details>
<summary>Following the general theme, the proof is identical
to the non-strong case.
</summary>
```agda
zero+indexed-coproduct-strong-projective→strong-projective {ι = ι} z coprod ∐P-pro i =
  retract→strong-projective ∐P-pro (ι i) $
  zero→ι-has-retract C coprod z i
```

## Enough strong projectives

A category $\cC$ is said to have **enough strong projectives** if for
object $X : \cC$ there is some strong epi $P \epi X$ with $P$ strong projective.
We will refer to these projectives as **projective presentations**
of $X$.

Note that there are two variations on this condition: one where
there *merely* exists a strong projective presentation for every $X$, and
another where those presentations are provided as structure. We prefer
to work with the latter, as it tends to be less painful to work with.

```agda
record Strong-projectives : Type (o ⊔ ℓ) where
  field
    Pro : Ob → Ob
    present : ∀ {X} → Hom (Pro X) X
    present-strong-epi : ∀ {X} → is-strong-epi (present {X})
    projective : ∀ {X} → is-strong-projective (Pro X)
```

<!--

module _ (coprods : (Idx : Set ℓ) → has-coproducts-indexed-by C ∣ Idx ∣)
  where
  open Cat.Diagram.Separator.Strong C coprods
  open Copowers coprods
```
-->

If $\cC$ has set-indexed coproducts, and $P_i$ is a [[strong separating family]]
with each $P_i$ a strong projective, then $\cC$ has enough strong projectives
if $\Sigma(i : Idx) (\cC(P_i, X))$ is a set-projective type.

```agda
  strong-projective-separating-faily→strong-projectives
    : ∀ {Idx : Set ℓ} {Pᵢ : ∣ Idx ∣ → Ob}
    → (∀ X → is-set-projective (Σ[ i ∈ ∣ Idx ∣ ] (Hom (Pᵢ i) X)) ℓ)
    → (∀ i → is-strong-projective (Pᵢ i))
    → is-strong-separating-family Idx Pᵢ
    → Strong-projectives
```

The hypotheses of this theorem basically give the game away: by definition,
there is a strong epimorphism $\coprod_{\Sigma(i : I) \cC(P_i, X)} S_i \to X$
for every $X$. Moreover, $\Sigma(i : I) \cC(P_i, X)$ is set-projective,
so the corresponding coproduct is a strong projective.

```agda
  strong-projective-separating-faily→strong-projectives
    {Idx} {Pᵢ} Idx-pro Pᵢ-pro strong-sep = strong-projectives where
    open Strong-projectives

    strong-projectives : Strong-projectives
    strong-projectives .Pro X =
      ∐! (Σ[ i ∈ ∣ Idx ∣ ] (Hom (Pᵢ i) X)) (Pᵢ ⊙ fst)
    strong-projectives .present {X = X} =
      ∐!.match (Σ[ i ∈ ∣ Idx ∣ ] (Hom (Pᵢ i) X)) (Pᵢ ⊙ fst) snd
    strong-projectives .present-strong-epi =
      strong-sep
    strong-projectives .projective {X = X} =
      indexed-coproduct-strong-projective

        (Pᵢ-pro ⊙ fst)
        (∐!.has-is-ic (Σ[ i ∈ ∣ Idx ∣ ] (Hom (Pᵢ i) X)) (Pᵢ ⊙ fst))
```
