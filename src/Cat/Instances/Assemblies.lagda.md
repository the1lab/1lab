# Assemblies over a PCA

When working over a [[partial combinatory algebra]] $\bA$, it's often
the case that we're interested in programs $\tt{p} : \bA$ as concrete
*implementations* of some mathematical datum $x : X$. For example, we
can implement the successor function on natural numbers to be
$$
\tt{suc} = \langle n \rangle \langle f \rangle \langle x \rangle\ f(nfx)
$$,
representing a numeral $n : \bN$ as a *Church numeral*, taking the
defining property of $\tt{suc}\, n$ to be that if we have some
iterable process $f : A \to A$ starting at $x : A$, then the
$(\operatorname{suc} n)$-th iteration is $f$ applied to the $n$th
iteration; But we could just as well implement
$$
\tt{suc} = \langle n \rangle\ \tt{pair}(\tt{false}, n)
$$
representing a numeral $n : \bN$ as a *Curry numeral*, a pair containing
the information of whether the number is zero and its predecessor (if
any). These implementations are extensionally identical, in that they
both denote the same actual natural number, but for a concrete pca $\bA$,
they might genuinely be different --- we could imagine measuring the
time complexity of the predecessor function, which is $O(1)$ for Curry
numbers and $O(n)$ for Church numbers. Therefore, if we are to
investigate the computational content of constructive mathematics, we
need a way to track the connection between the mathematical elements $x
: X$ and the programs $\tt{p} : \bA$ which denote them.

:::{.definition #assembly}
An **assembly** over a pca $\bA$ is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a
[[propositional|proposition]] relation $\tt{p} \Vdash x$ between
[[values|values in a pca]] $\tt{p} : \bA$ and elements $x : X$; when
this holds, we say $\tt{p}$ **realises** $x$. Moreover, for every $x :
X$, we require that there be at least one $\tt{p}$ which realises it.
:::

::: warning
The construction of assemblies over $\bA$, and the category
$\thecat{Asm}(\bA)$, works regardless of *which* pca $\bA$ we choose ---
but we only get something *interesting* if $\bA$ is [[nontrivial|trivial
pca]]: the category $\thecat{Asm}(*)$ over the trivial pca is the
category $\Sets$.

Therefore, when making natural-language statements about
$\thecat{Asm}(\bA)$, we generally assume that $\bA$ is nontrivial. A
statement like "the category $\thecat{Asm}(\bA)$ is not
[[univalent|univalent category]]" should be read as saying "univalence
of $\thecat{Asm}(\bA)$ implies $\bA$ is trivial".

```agda
record Assembly (𝔸 : PCA ℓA) ℓ : Type (lsuc ℓ ⊔ ℓA) where
  no-eta-equality
  field
    Ob         : Type ℓ
    has-is-set : is-set Ob
    realisers  : Ob → ℙ⁺ 𝔸
    realised   : ∀ x → ∃[ a ∈ ↯ ⌞ 𝔸 ⌟ ] (a ∈ realisers x)
```

A prototypical example is the assembly of booleans, `𝟚`{.Agda}, defined
[below](#the-assembly-of-booleans). Its set of elements is
`Bool`{.Agda}, and we fix realisers

$$
\begin{align*}
\left(\langle x \rangle \langle y \rangle\ x\right) \Vdash&\ \rm{true}\\
\left(\langle x \rangle \langle y \rangle\ y\right) \Vdash&\ \rm{false;}
\end{align*}
$$

see [[booleans in a pca]] for the details of the construction. This is
not the only possible choice: we could, for example, say that the value
`true`{.Agda} is implemented by the *program* $\tt{false}$ (and
vice-versa). This results in a genuinely different assembly *over
`Bool`{.Agda}*,[^bool] though with the same denotational data.

[^bool]:
    The assembly `𝟚`{.Agda} and its "flipped" variant obtained by
    swapping which boolean program realises each boolean value *are*
    isomorphic (even identical) in the category of assemblies, since the
    `` `not ``{.Agda} program is a computable involution.

    They are only distinct if considered as "assemblies over
    `Bool`{.Agda}", where (following the logic of [[vertical maps|fibre
    category]]) we restrict our attention to the isomorphisms with
    underlying function the identity.

To understand the difference --- and similarity --- between the ordinary
assembly of booleans and the swapped booleans, we define a morphism of
assemblies $(X, \Vdash_X) \to (Y, \Vdash_Y)$ to be a function $f : X \to
Y$ satisfying the [[*property*|propositional truncation]] that there
exists a program $\tt{f} : \bA$ which sends realisers of $x : X$ to
realisers of $f(x) : Y$.

```agda
record Assembly-hom {𝔸 : PCA ℓA} (X : Assembly 𝔸 ℓ) (Y : Assembly 𝔸 ℓ') : Type (ℓA ⊔ ℓ ⊔ ℓ') where

  field
    map     : ⌞ X ⌟ → ⌞ Y ⌟
    tracked : ∥ [ map ] X .realisers ⊢ Y .realisers ∥
```

Note the force of the propositional truncation in this definition: maps
of assemblies are identical *when they have the same underlying
function*, regardless of which programs potentially implement them.
Since we can not, for a general $\bA$, show that the programs
$\mathtt{f}$ and $\langle a \rangle \tt{f}\, a$ are identical,
$\thecat{Asm}(\bA)$ would not be a category if the choice of realiser
mattered for identity of computable maps.

This consideration is necessary for assemblies and assembly morphisms to
be a category: in an arbitrary pca $\bA$, composition of programs need
not be unital or associative.

## The assembly of booleans

The assembly of booleans, $\tt{2}$, is the simplest example of an
assembly which contains actual computability data. Its construction is
entirely straightforward:

```agda
  𝟚 : Assembly 𝔸 lzero
  𝟚 .Ob          = Bool
  𝟚 .has-is-set  = hlevel 2
  𝟚 .realisers true  = singleton⁺ `true
  𝟚 .realisers false = singleton⁺ `false
  𝟚 .realised  true  = inc (`true .fst , inc refl)
  𝟚 .realised  false = inc (`false .fst , inc refl)
```

We define the realisability relation as a function from `Bool`{.Agda},
by cases: the only option for realising the boolean `true`{.Agda} is
with the `` `true ``{.Agda} program, and similarly the `false`{.Agda}
boolean is realised by the `` `false ``{.Agda} program.

## Indiscrete assemblies

However, the *assembly* of booleans is not the only assembly we can
construct on the *type* of booleans. As mentioned above, we could also
have inverted which program realises each boolean; but this is *still*
an assembly with nontrivial computability data. Now, we show that the
"ambient" world of sets and functions embeds [[fully faithful|fully
faithful functor]] into the category of assemblies over any pca $\bA$.

This is, perhaps, a bit surprising: maps of assemblies are computable by
definition, but arbitrary functions between sets need not be! The catch
is that, when equipping a set with the structure of an assembly, *we*
get to choose which programs compute which elements; and, above, we have
made a sensible choice. But we can always make an *adversarial* choice,
letting *every* program at all realise any element.

::: terminology
We denote the **indiscrete assembly** on a set $X$ as $\nabla X$,
following the literature. Note however that Bauer
[-@Bauer:Realisability] refers to these as *constant assemblies*, while
de Jong [-@deJong:Realisability] does not assign them a name but merely
singles them out as embedding classical logic in $\thecat{Asm}(\bA)$.
:::

```agda
  ∇ : ∀ {ℓ} (X : Type ℓ) ⦃ _ : H-Level X 2 ⦄ → Assembly 𝔸 ℓ
  ∇ X .Ob          = X
  ∇ X .has-is-set  = hlevel 2
  ∇ X .realisers x = defineds
  ∇ X .realised  x = inc (expr ⟨ x ⟩ x , abs↓ _ _)
```

The important thing to know about these is that any function of sets $X
\to Y$ extends to a computable map of assemblies $(X, \Vdash) \to \nabla
Y$ --- this is because the only requirement for $e \Vdash_{\nabla Y} f\,
x$ is that $e$ is defined, and assemblies are defined so that if $e
\Vdash_X x$ then $e$ is defined.

```agda
  extend
    : ∀ {ℓ ℓ'} {X : Assembly 𝔸 ℓ} {Y : Type ℓ'} ⦃ _ : H-Level Y 2 ⦄
    → (⌞ X ⌟ → Y) → Assembly-hom X (∇ Y)
  extend {X = X} f = to-assembly-hom record where
    map x     = f x
    realiser  = val ⟨ x ⟩ x
    tracks ha = subst ⌞_⌟ (sym (abs-β _ []v (_ , X .def ha))) (X .def ha)
```

<details>
<summary>Following the general logic of [[adjoint functors]], this means
that $\nabla (-)$ is a functor $\Sets \to \thecat{Asm}(\bA)$, for any
$\bA$ at all --- and moreover that $\nabla$ is a [[right adjoint]] to
the functor $\Gamma : \thecat{Asm}(\bA) \to \Sets$ which projects the
underlying set of each assembly.</summary>

</details>

The indiscrete assemblies $\nabla X$ are generally poor as *domains* for
computable functions, since a realiser for $f : \nabla X \to (Y,
\Vdash)$ would have to choose realisers for $f(x)$ given no information
about $x$. Indeed, we can show that if there are non-constant maps
$\nabla \{0, 1\} \to \tt{2}$, then $\bA$ is [[trivial|trivial pca]].

```agda

    → f · true ≠ f · false
    → is-trivial-pca 𝔸
  non-constant-nabla-map f x = case f .tracked of λ where
    record { realiser = (fp , f↓) ; tracks = t } →
      let
        a = t {true}  {`true .fst} (`true .snd)
        b = t {false} {`true .fst} (`true .snd)
