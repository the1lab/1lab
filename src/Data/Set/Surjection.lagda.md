# Surjections between sets {defines="surjection-between-sets"}

Here we prove that surjective maps are exactly the [regular epimorphisms]
in the category of sets: Really, we prove that surjections are regular
epimorphisms (this is straightforward), then we prove that every
[epimorphism] is a surjection (this takes a detour). Putting these
together, we get _every epimorphism is regular_ as a corollary.

## Surjections are epic {defines="surjections-are-epic"}

This is the straightforward direction: We know (since $\Sets$ has
pullbacks) that if a morphism is going to be a regular epimorphism, then
it must be an _effective_ epimorphism, too: so if it is to coequalise
any morphisms, it certainly coequalises its kernel pair.

```agda
surjective→regular-epi
  : ∀ {ℓ} (c d : n-Type ℓ 2) (f : ∣ c ∣ → ∣ d ∣)
  → is-surjective f
  → is-regular-epi (Sets ℓ) {c} {d} f
surjective→regular-epi c _ f x .r = el! (Σ ∣ c ∣ λ x → Σ ∣ c ∣ λ y → f x ≡ f y)
surjective→regular-epi _ _ f x .arr₁ = λ (y , _ , _) → y
surjective→regular-epi _ _ f x .arr₂ = λ (_ , y , _) → y
```

That's our choice of cofork: it remains to show that $f$ coequalises
this. Given any map $e' : c \to F$, element $x : d$, mere fibre
$f^*(x)$, and proof $p$ that $e'$ is constant on the kernel pair of $f$
(i.e. that it also coequalises the kernel pair cofork), we can construct
an element of $F$: since $e'$ is suitably constant, we can use the
elimination principle for $\| f^*x \| \to F$, since $F$ is a set.

```agda
surjective→regular-epi c d f surj .has-is-coeq = coeqs where
  go : ∀ {F} (e' : ∣ c ∣ → ∣ F ∣) p (x : ∣ d ∣) → ∥ fibre f x ∥ → ∣ F ∣
  go e' p x =
    ∥-∥-rec-set (hlevel 2) (λ x → e' (x .fst))
      (λ x y → p $ₚ (x .fst , y .fst , x .snd ∙ sym (y .snd)))
```

After a small amount of computation to move the witnesses of
surjectivity out of the way, we get what we wanted.

```agda
  coeqs : is-coequaliser (Sets _) _ _ _
  coeqs .coequal i (x , y , p) = p i
  coeqs .universal {F} {e'} p x = go {F = F} e' p x (surj x)
  coeqs .factors {F} {e'} {p = p} = funext λ x →
    ∥-∥-elim {P = λ e → go {F} e' p (f x) e ≡ e' x}
      (λ x → hlevel 1) (λ e → p $ₚ (e .fst , x , e .snd)) (surj (f x))
  coeqs .unique {F} {e'} {p} {colim} comm = funext λ a →
    ∥-∥-elim {P = λ e → colim a ≡ go {F} e' p a e} (λ x → hlevel 1)
      (λ x → ap colim (sym (x .snd)) ∙ comm $ₚ x .fst)
      (surj a)
```

# Epis are surjective {defines="epis-are-surjective"}

Now _this_ is the hard direction. Our proof follows [@Rijke:2015, §2.9],
so if the exposition below doesn't make a lot of sense, be sure to check
their paper, too. We define a higher inductive type standing for the
_cofibre_ of $f$, also known as the _mapping cone_. Strictly speaking,
this is the homotopy pushout

~~~{.quiver}
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  A && B \\
  \\
  \top && {\mathrm{Cofibre}(f)\text{,}}
  \arrow["{\mathrm{pt}}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
  \arrow["{\mathrm{inr}}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
  \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-3]
  \arrow["{!}"', from=1-1, to=3-1]
  \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=3-3, to=1-1]
\end{tikzcd}\]
~~~

but Cubical Agda makes it very convenient to define a purpose-built HIT
in-line. We use the names "tip", "base", and "cone" to evoke the
construction of a cone in solid geometry: the `tip`{.Agda} is.. the tip,
the `base`{.Agda} is the circle, and the `cone`{.Agda} is the triangular
side which we have rotated around the vertical axis.

```agda
data Cofibre {ℓ ℓ'} {A : Type ℓ} {B : Type ℓ'} (f : A → B) : Type (ℓ ⊔ ℓ') where
  tip  : Cofibre f
  base : B → Cofibre f
  cone : ∀ a → tip ≡ base (f a)
```

What's important here is that if a map $f$ has [[connected]] cofibre, then
it is a surjection --- so our proof that epis are surjective will factor
through showing that epis have connected cofibres^[note that all of
these types are propositions, so we have a bunch of equivalences].

```agda
connected-cofibre→surjective
  : ∀ {ℓ ℓ'} {A : Type ℓ} {B : Type ℓ'} (f : A → B)
  → is-connected (Cofibre f)
  → is-surjective f
connected-cofibre→surjective {A = A} {B = B} f conn x = transport cen (lift tt) where
```

We define a family $P$ of propositions over $\rm{Cofibre}(f)$ which maps
`tip`{.Agda} to the unit proposition and the base point with coordinate
$x$ to the fibre $f^x$. Since $\rm{Prop}$ is a set, $P$ extends to a map
$P' : \| \rm{Cofibre}(f) \|_0 \to \rm{Prop}$.

```agda
  P : Cofibre f → Prop _
  P tip      = el! (Lift _ ⊤)
  P (base x) = el! ∥ fibre f x ∥
  P (cone a i) =
    n-ua {X = el! (Lift _ ⊤)} {Y = el! ∥ fibre f (f a) ∥}
      (prop-ext! (λ _ → inc (a , refl)) λ _ → lift tt) i

  P' : ∥ Cofibre f ∥₀ → Prop _
  P' = ∥-∥₀-elim (λ _ → hlevel 2) P
```

Letting $x$ be an element of the codomain, and since by assumption $f$'s
cofibre is connected, we have a path

$$
\top = P'(\rm{tip}) = P'(\rm{base}_x) = \| f^x \|
$$,

so since the unit type is trivially inhabited, so is the fibre of $f$
over $x$: $f$ is surjective.

```agda
  cen : Lift _ ⊤ ≡ ∥ fibre f x ∥
  cen = ap ∣_∣ (ap P' (is-contr→is-prop conn (inc tip) (inc (base x))))
```

## Epis have connected cofibre

Now suppose that $f$ is an epic morphism ^[by which we mean it is an
epimorphism --- it needn't be like the Odyssey] ^[and yes, we did write
"an epic morphism" just to make the joke]. We know that the
set-truncation of $f$'s cofibre is inhabited (since every cofibre is
inhabited), so it remains to show that any two points are merely equal.

```agda
epi→connected-cofibre
  : ∀ {ℓ} (c d : n-Type ℓ 2) (f : ∣ c ∣ → ∣ d ∣)
  → Cr.is-epic (Sets ℓ) {c} {d} f
  → is-connected (Cofibre f)
epi→connected-cofibre c d f epic = contr (inc tip) $
  ∥-∥₀-elim (λ _ → is-prop→is-set (squash _ _)) λ w →
    ∥-∥₀-path.from (hom w)
  where
```

Let $x : d$ --- we'll show that $\| \rm{tip} = \rm{base}_x \|$. Here's
where we use $f$'s epimorphy: we have a homotopy $| \rm{tip} | = |
\rm{base}_{(f x)} |$, namely the `cone`{.Agda} --- and since we can
write its left-hand-side as the composition of $f$ with a constant
function, $f$ gives us a path $| \rm{tip} | = | \rm{base}_x |$ ---
which, by the characterisation of paths in the [[set truncation]], means
we merely have $\| \rm{tip} = \rm{base}_x \|$.

```agda
    go : ∀ x → ∥ tip ≡ base x ∥
    go x = ∥-∥₀-path.to (p $ₚ x) where
      p = epic {c = el ∥ Cofibre f ∥₀ squash}
        (λ _ → inc tip)
        (λ x → inc (base x))
        (funext λ x → ap ∥_∥₀.inc (cone x))
```

An appeal to induction over the cofibre completes the proof:
Epimorphisms have connected cofibres. Note that the path case is
discharged automatically since we're mapping into a proposition.

```agda
    hom : ∀ w → ∥ tip ≡ w ∥
    hom tip = inc refl
    hom (base x) = go x
    hom (cone a i) = is-prop→pathp (λ i → ∥_∥.squash {A = tip ≡ cone a i})
      (inc refl) (go (f a)) i
```

And, composing this with the previous step, we have what we originally
set out to prove: all $\Sets$-epimorphisms are regular, because they're
all surjections!

```agda
epi→surjective
  : ∀ {ℓ} (c d : n-Type ℓ 2) (f : ∣ c ∣ → ∣ d ∣)
  → Cr.is-epic (Sets ℓ) {c} {d} f
  → is-surjective f
epi→surjective {ℓ} c d f epi x =
  connected-cofibre→surjective f (epi→connected-cofibre c d f (λ {x} → epi {x})) x
```
