# Membership in lists

We can inductively define a notion of membership between elements $a :
A$ and lists $as : \List{A}$; we write $a \in_l as$. However, note that
this notion of membership is **not** a [[proposition]]! The type $a
\in_l as$ has at least as many inhabitants as there are occurrences of
$a$ in $as$; and if the type $A$ is not a set, then each proof of $a \in
as$ can be acted on by a loop on $a$ to give a new proof.

```agda
data _∈ₗ_ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} (x : A) : List A → Type ℓ where
  here  : ∀ {x'} (p : x ≡ᵢ x') → x ∈ₗ (x' ∷ xs)
  there : (p : x ∈ₗ xs)        → x ∈ₗ (y ∷ xs)
```

<!--
```agda
here≠there : ∀ {A : Type ℓ} {xs : List A} {x y : A} {p : x ≡ᵢ y} {q : x ∈ₗ xs} → here p ≠ there q
here≠there p = subst (λ { (here _) → ⊤ ; (there _) → ⊥ }) p tt
```

There is a more (homotopically) straightforward characterisation of
membership in lists: the [[fibres]] of the lookup function `xs !
i`{.Agda ident=!_}. These are given by an index $i :
[\operatorname{length}(xs)]$, living in the [[standard finite set]] with
as many elements as the list has positions, together with a proof that
$xs \mathbin{!} i = x$.

The inverse equivalences between these notions is defined below; the
proof that they are _are_ inverses is a straightforward induction in
both cases, so it's omitted for space.

```agda
member→lookup : ∀ {x : A} {xs} → x ∈ xs → fibreᵢ (xs !_) x
member→lookup (here p) = fzero , symᵢ p
member→lookup (there prf) with member→lookup prf
... | ix , p = fsuc ix , p

lookup→member : ∀ {x : A} {xs} → fibreᵢ (xs !_) x → x ∈ xs
lookup→member {A = A} {x = x} = λ (ix , p) → go ix p module lookup→member where
  go : ∀ {xs} (ix : Fin (length xs)) → (xs ! ix) ≡ᵢ x → x ∈ xs
  go ix _  with fin-view ix
  go {xs = x ∷ xs} _ p | zero     = here  (symᵢ p)
  go {xs = x ∷ xs} _ p | (suc ix) = there (go ix p)
```

The equivalence between these definitions explains why $a \in_l as$ can
be so complicated. First, it's at least a set, since it stores the
index. Second, it stores a path, which can be arbitrarily complicated
depending on the type $A$.

lookup→member→lookup : ∀ {x : A} {xs} (f : fibreᵢ (xs !_) x) → member→lookup (lookup→member f) ≡ f
lookup→member→lookup {A = A} {x = x} (ix , p) = go ix p where
  go : ∀ {xs} (ix : Fin (length xs)) (p : xs ! ix ≡ᵢ x) → member→lookup (lookup→member.go {xs = xs} ix p) ≡ (ix , p)
  go ix p with fin-view ix
  go {xs = x ∷ xs} _ reflᵢ | zero   = refl
  go {xs = x ∷ xs} _ p     | suc ix = Σ-pathp (ap fsuc (ap fst p')) (ap snd p')
    where p' = go {xs = xs} ix p

  : {x : A} {xs : List A} (p : x ∈ xs) → p ≡ lookup→member (member→lookup p)
member→lookup→member (here reflᵢ) = refl
member→lookup→member (there p)    = ap there (member→lookup→member p)

member≃lookup : ∀ {x : A} {xs} → (x ∈ₗ xs) ≃ fibreᵢ (xs !_) x
member≃lookup .fst = member→lookup

  .is-iso.inv  p → lookup→member p
  .is-iso.rinv p → lookup→member→lookup p
  .is-iso.linv p → sym (member→lookup→member p)
```

Despite the potential complexity of $a \in_l as$, we do note that if $A$
is a [[set]], then all that matters is the index; If $A$ is moreover
[[discrete]], then $a \in_l as$ is [[decidable]].

```agda
elem? : ⦃ _ : Discrete A ⦄ (x : A) (xs : List A) → Dec (x ∈ xs)
elem? x [] = no λ ()
elem? x (y ∷ xs) with x ≡ᵢ? y
... | yes p = yes (here p)
... | no ¬p with elem? x xs
... | yes p = yes (there p)
... | no ¬q = no λ { (here p) → ¬p p ; (there q) → ¬q q }
```

<!--

## Removing duplicates

Still working with a discrete type, we can define a function
`nub`{.Agda} which removes duplicates from a list. It is constructed by
inductively deciding whether or not to keep the head of the list,
discarding those which already appear further down. This has terrible
the terrible time complexity $O(n^2)$, but it works for an arbitrary
discrete type, which is the best possible generality.

```agda
nub-cons : (x : A) (xs : List A) → Dec (x ∈ xs) → List A
nub-cons x xs (yes _) = xs
nub-cons x xs (no _)  = x ∷ xs

nub : ⦃ _ : Discrete A ⦄ → List A → List A
nub []       = []
nub (x ∷ xs) = nub-cons x (nub xs) (elem? x (nub xs))
```

The function `nub`{.Agda} is characterised by the following two facts.
First, membership in `nub`{.Agda} is a proposition --- each element
appears at most once. Second, membership is (logically) preserved when
`nub`{.Agda}bing a list --- note that the function mapping old indices
to new indices is not injective, since all occurrences of an element
will be mapped to the same (first) occurrence in the deduplicated list.
