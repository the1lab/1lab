# Total partial elements {defines="total-partial-element"}

An important property of the [[partial elements]] $x : \zap A$ is that
if $x$ is defined, then it is necessarily the inclusion of a unique
*total* value $x' : A$. However, when formalising, we have to contend
with the following infelicity: if we start with a partial element $x :
\zap A$, extract an underlying value $x' : A$ by proving that it is
defined, and then subsequently weaken $x'$ back to a partial element, we
do not *definitionally* end up back with $x$.

This turns into a compound annoyance when we're dealing with partial
operators, like those of a [[partial combinatory algebra]], since we
want to ergonomically build complex expressions--- which entails
'lifting' a partial operator $A \to A \to \zap A$ to a binary operation
on $\zap A$ using the monadic structure of $\zap(-)$--- but the
properties that control these operators only apply when the domains are
actually defined. We would thus have to insert tons of mediating
identifications between a (defined) partial element and the inclusion of
its underlying value.

A better approach from the perspective of formalisation is thus to
*delay projecting the underlying value* as long as possible. Instead, we
prefer to work with partial elements and carry the proofs that they are
defined 'off to the side'. To make this precise, we define a type
$\zap^+ A$ of **defined partial elements** of $A$, which, extensionally,
is just $A$ again; but which, intensionally, lets us definitionally
recover a partial $x : \zap A$ after proving that it is defined, by
merely projecting out the underlying partial element.

↯⁺ : ∀ {ℓ} {X : Type ℓ} ⦃ u : Underlying X ⦄ → X → Type _
↯⁺ A = Σ[ a ∈ ↯ ⌞ A ⌟ ] ⌞ a ⌟

It's actually very easy to prove that this type is equivalent to $A$,
which at a glance might call its utility into question --- but it will
be extensively used in the development of realisability.

from-total (a , ha) = a .elt ha

## Total power sets

We can perform a similar replacement to the power set $\bP A$, pairing a
predicate on *partial* elements $P \sube \zap A$ with a proof that every
member of $P$ is defined. Again, this is equivalent to $\bP A$, but it
lets us talk directly about the membership of partial elements in $P$,
even those which are not *a priori* known to be defined.

```agda
  record ℙ⁺ (A : Type ℓ) : Type ℓ where
    field
      mem : ↯ A → Ω
      def : ∀ {a} → ⌞ mem a ⌟ → ⌞ a ⌟

Of course, if we have a predicate $P \sube A$, we can extend it to a $P'
\sube \zap A$ defined on partial elements by defining $x \in P'$ to mean
"$x$ is defined and the projection of $x$ onto $A$ belongs to $P$".  By
construction, every member of $P'$ is defined.

```agda
from-total-predicate : ℙ A → ℙ⁺ A
from-total-predicate P .mem x = el (Σ[ hx ∈ x ] x .elt hx ∈ P) (hlevel 1)
from-total-predicate P .def (hx , _) = hx
